# Bedwars

In this repository is everything about Little Flower's Bedwars private server maintained, including map drafts, instructions, code, etc. 

## Introduction

Bedwars is a game based on ''non-modified'' [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/) 1.13. You can join by Minecraft Java with 1.13. The server is maintained by 'Xxy Flying'. 

Each team has a bed, which is to be protected by surrounding it with blocks. After it is destroyed by other teams, players of this team no longer respawn. Your goal is to protect your own team's bed, destroy other teams' beds, and kill every enemy. 

In the game of Bedwars, you spawn on your base, which is an island on which lie your team's bed, an iron-and-gold resource spawn point, and some villagers for you to trade with. You collect spawned resources and barter for blocks, armors, weapons, food, etc. You build a bridge to other islands, on which may be more resources that you collect, or which may be another team's island whose bed you destroy. If all survivors are from a single team, that team wins. After your team's bed is destroyed, you become a spectator, who does nothing but witnessing, as soon as you are killed. 

## Respawn system

As you are killed of any reason, the (Minecraft built-in) death screen shows, you click the respawn button, you respawn at a departure of a 5-second running track that is team-local (so there is no fight). As you reach the destination, you are teleported to your base. So the respawn is completed. Note that your inventory is not dropped and potentially grabbed by your enemies, but not keeped either (in fact, it is cleared). 

## Resources

There are five kinds of resources: iron, gold, diamond, emerald, and nether star. Iron, gold and emerald are respectively used to barter for preliminary, medium and advanced weapons, armors, etc. Diamond is mainly for enchantment. Nether star is for potions. 

Iron and gold are spawned at the resource spawn point in each team's base, so they can be collected at the very beginning. Diamond spawn points are on nearby separate islands. Emerald spawn points are on the central (farther away) island. Nether star is not collected but achieved by contiguously killing a sufficient number of enemies.
